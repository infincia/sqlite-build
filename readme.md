### SQLite static library builds for Windows

These are built by CI infrastructure with strict settings for the compiler toolchain.

The `*_xp` variants use the `v120_xp` and `v140_xp` toolchains for Windows XP support in Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, respectively.

Each build includes both MT and MD versions of the library.
